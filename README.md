AGA Online Ratings protocol and implementation

The goal of the AGA Online Ratings Protocol is to provide Go Servers with a standard way to report results between AGA members that happen on their servers to us for computing a cross-server rating.

Other goals of the project can be found on the [implementation plan here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XOcpprw0Y8xhHTroYnUU7tt0rN6F3-T4_9sgOeifqwI)
